# Written Proposal


## Problem and Audience
People want reminders they can trust, but many apps feel either too basic or too complicated.  
Peckly solves this with a local-first experience that works offline and still supports optional cloud sync.  
It is built for busy individuals, students, and families who need predictable daily planning.

## Monetization Strategy
Peckly uses a freemium model: free users can create up to 15 reminders and 5 lists.  
Premium removes those limits and is offered when users naturally hit them during normal usage.  
This keeps the app accessible while charging only users who need more capacity.
